# Face Recognition API

API built using flask returns face embedding vector as response.

## Getting Started

This API uses deep learning to generate face embedding 128 dimension vector using Keras on top of tensorflow.\
Implementation is ["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832). Inception-ResNet-v2 model.  

Use 128 dimension vectors of different faces and match by calculating euclidean distace for each face with specified threshold. 

### Prerequisites
